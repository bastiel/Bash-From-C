# PA 1 Reflection - Nghi Vu

Although vi/Vim is usually installed onto every system by default, I opted to use Neovim instead because I wanted the familarity of an IDE while still using the "efficiency" and low resource usage of Vim. All of the foundations of Vim are still present in Neovim, such as the shortcuts. The only difference is that I also get a file explorer, multiple windows for different files, a terminal, code completion, syntax highlighting, and so on. Basically, if I ever need to use vi/Vim proper, I would be able to navigate it just fine - in the mean time, I get to have extra convenience. 

Specifically, I used pre-configured setups for Neovim made by other people mainly because I don't necessarily care too much about customization - I just need something that works. I used a configuration called AstroNvim. Regarding plugin installation and customization, I put in enough effort to get it to work. I didn't bother learning how to customize about 95% of the plugins. Regarding the basics of Vim, I would say it was a huge pain to learn, but I eventually got used to it. I still forget which direction J and K go in, but practically every other basic shortcut I remember. I don't think it took too much effort mainly because I have some prior experience using it before class, but also I started using it during class before we were required to, so I got some practice in. 

I haven't had to debug anything yet - the compiler errors have been mostly getting me through the coding. But while there are plugins and native features that enable debuggers in Vim/Neovim, I don't think I would be too thrilled to use it. I'll learn it just so I can use it in a pitch when more fancy features and programs aren't available, but once I learn it, I'll probably swith to a real IDE to debug my code unless required otherwise.
